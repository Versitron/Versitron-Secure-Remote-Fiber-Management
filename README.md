## Secure Remote Fiber Management

**Reliable long-distance management of security and access systems over fiber.**

- Enables remote monitoring and control of building systems through secure fiber links  
- Immune to EMI/RFI, electrical interference, and signal tampering  
- Supports serial-based control systems for gates, alarm panels, PLCs, and access devices  
- Allows centralized oversight of multiple remote sites or secure facilities  

Ideal for industrial campuses, government buildings, corporate facilities, and secure infrastructure.

## Building Access RS-232 to Fiber

**Extend RS-232 access control signals over fiber for enhanced security and reliability.**

- Converts legacy **RS-232 door control or access panel signals** to fiber for long-distance transmission  
- Eliminates copper-based weaknesses such as interference, signal loss, and data tapping  
- Supports badge readers, access controllers, keypads, and entry management systems  
- Provides consistent performance for secure perimeter and building access  

Perfect for secure entry points, multi-building access networks, and enterprise security systems.

## Fiber Converter for Biometric Readers

**High-security fiber solutions for fingerprint, retina, and facial recognition systems.**

- Extends biometric reader communication using fiber to avoid distance limitations  
- Prevents data interception — fiber is inherently resistant to tapping and signal manipulation  
- Compatible with RS-232, RS-485, and other serial connectivity used in biometric devices  
- Ensures accurate, real-time authentication across large facilities  

Suitable for labs, government buildings, research centers, and advanced identity-verification installations.

## Secure Door Control Serial Modem

**Fiber-based modems for reliable and tamper-resistant door control communication.**

- Converts door control serial signals (RS-232/RS-485/RS-530) into optical transmission  
- Eliminates disruptions from electrical noise, surges, lightning, and ground loops  
- Provides consistent door relay, lock command, and sensor feedback transmission  
- Enhances security for perimeter doors, restricted zones, and mission-critical access points  

Ideal for high-security facilities, military sites, data centers, and commercial access systems.
